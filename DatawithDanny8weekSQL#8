B. Digital Analysis
1. How many users are there?

SELECT count(Distinct user_id) as users FROM clique_bait.users;

2. How many cookies does each user have on average?

With i as (SELECT Distinct user_id, count(cookie_id) as cookie_count FROM clique_bait.users
group by user_id
order by user_id)

Select round(avg(cookie_count),2) as aerage_count from i;

3. What is the unique number of visits by all users per month?

Select To_char(e.event_time, 'Month') as Month, count(Distinct e.visit_id) FROM clique_bait.events as e
inner join clique_bait.users as u
on u.cookie_id = e.cookie_id
group by Month
order by Month;

4. What is the number of events for each event type?

Select e.event_type, ei.event_name, count(*) from clique_bait.events as e
inner join clique_bait.event_identifier as ei
on e.event_type = ei.event_type
group by e.event_type, ei.event_name
order by e.event_type;

5. What is the percentage of visits which have a purchase event?

WITH cte_visits_with_purchase_flag AS (
  SELECT
    visit_id,
    Sum(CASE WHEN event_type = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase_flag
  FROM clique_bait.events
  GROUP BY visit_id
)
SELECT
  ROUND(100 * SUM(purchase_flag) / COUNT(*), 2) AS purchase_percentage
FROM cte_visits_with_purchase_flag;

6. What is the percentage of visits which view the checkout page but do not have a purchase event?

WITH i AS (
  SELECT
    visit_id,
    Sum(CASE WHEN event_type = 1 and page_id = 12 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS view_flag,
  Sum(CASE WHEN event_type = 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS purchase_flag
  FROM clique_bait.events
  GROUP BY visit_id
)

SELECT
  ROUND(100 * SUM(CASE WHEN purchase_flag = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::NUMERIC / COUNT(*), 2) AS checkout_without_purchase_percentage
FROM i
WHERE view_flag != 0;

7. What are the top 3 pages by number of views?

SELECT p.page_name, sum(case when e.event_type = 1 then 1 else 0 end) as page_views 
FROM clique_bait.events as e
inner join clique_bait.event_identifier  as ei
on e.event_type = ei.event_type
inner join clique_bait.page_hierarchy  as p
on p.page_id = e.page_id
group by p.page_name
order by page_views desc
Limit 3

8. What is the number of views and cart adds for each product category?

SELECT p.product_category, sum(case when e.event_type = 1 then 1 else 0 end) as page_views, sum(case when e.event_type = 2 then 1 else 0 end) as cart_adds
FROM clique_bait.events as e
inner join clique_bait.event_identifier  as ei
on e.event_type = ei.event_type
inner join clique_bait.page_hierarchy  as p
on p.page_id = e.page_id
where p.product_category is not null
group by p.product_category
order by page_views desc
